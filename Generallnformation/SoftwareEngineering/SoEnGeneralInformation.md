#### Project start:
Start Approx. Middle of January 2023.

#### Project Submission date
Approx. End of March 2023

## Project Deliverables
The following MUST be delivered. If some of the listed artifacts are missing, the project will be rejected.

### 1. The source code

All students in the group share the same solution in a single branch. The solution must contain at least the project with the related algorithm and the project with unit tests.

The project structure should look like under folder **MyProject**. See [MyProjectSample]
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1756871/104189792-7644c280-541b-11eb-8ba2-468c9b301f65.png)

In the end, add to your project 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers' NuGet package. This package will generate
warnings, which you should fix to increase the code quality.

### 2. Project documentation

Every student in the group must write a document, which describes the work as defined by the IEEE template.
Do not use too many code-snippets and pictures to make documents appear larger. Use some code snippets and the references for the UnitTests, which contains all code.

The documentation folder should contain the following files:
- YourProjectName.pdf (Docx saved as pdf)
- YourProjectName.docx (Project documentation in IEEE [ieee template](https://github.com/UniversityOfAppliedSciencesFrankfurt/se-cloud-2022-2023/blob/master/Generallnformation/Report%20Template%20A4%20Masters%20course%20IT.docx))
- YourProjectName.pptx (used for video)
- YourPojectName.mp4

Examples:

~~~
"ML19-20-19-3 Validate and Improve Tests of existing algorithms.mp4"
"ML20-21-15-1 HTM Spatial Pooler.pptx"
~~~

Do not paste code as an image. Use very short code snippets and the reference to the code in the repository.
For example:

---------------------------------------------------------
>  .. Following method GetHammingDistance [7] shows simplified how to calculate the Hamming Distance

~~~
void GetHammingDistance
{
  var a = b + 1
}
~~~
. . .

---------------------------------------------------------

All figures, tables, listings, etc. must have a number and description, and they MUST be referenced from text.

### 3. Project video (MP4)

Video is required delivery for every project with a single student or a group. Video duration is min. 5 min. and max 10 min.
If you work in the group, every student in the group can produce its own video, or every student CAN be a part of the group video. In any case, every student must appear in the video.
Please introduce yourself (speak your name clearly) and then explain the part of your project and give a problem statement related to your task in the context of the project.
We are not expecting professional videos, but we will not allow very unprofessional videos. The video should be a serious one.
To record videos you can use any software you want. One very easy option is to use some conferencing software (license free) like https://zoom.us. You can record yourself and you can record a shared screen.
You will also provide us a signed form, which allows us to publish the video. In the case of publishing, we are not doing any marketing. We will simply put the link to the video and your documentation in Github.
