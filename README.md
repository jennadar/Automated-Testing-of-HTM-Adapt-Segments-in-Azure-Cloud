# Automated-Testing-of-HTM-Adapt-Segments-in-Azure-Cloud
In this project, I've developed a dummy cloud-based solution utilizing Azure services for automated testing of adapt segments in a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model. The goal is to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the adapt segment functionality by running unit tests with various input scenarios extracted from large input files.
